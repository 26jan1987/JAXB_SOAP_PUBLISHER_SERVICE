# JAXB_SOAP_PUBLISHER_SERVICE
This project is a SOAP service that marshalls a given java object to XML format using JAXB and publishes the data as a String.
The XML file path is hard-coded in this case (can be changed when you fork this package).

The source code can be found in /src folder.
Within this are 3 sub-folders:
    1. art - The artwork java class and its dependencies, generated by JAXB based on the XML-Schema
    2. jaxb - This folder contains the marshaller class, that can marhsall the java object (artwork) into XML format
    3. pg - This folder contains the Java interface end-point and Implementation classes

The class "Artwork" generated within /src/art can be replaced with any new class generated by JAXB based on the given XML schema and the corresponding references need to be changed in src/jaxb and src/pg to implement this service.

Execute the "server.java" file in src/com/pg/ folder and the endpoint will be published "http://localhost:9393/artwork" (in this case).
